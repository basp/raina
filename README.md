# raina
Code metrics for .NET assemblies.

> Feminine form of Ray (Old German) "wise guardian".

> Strong and solid, with a touch of foreign intrigue.

>  The rain jokes are never ending and all at once no one will spell it right.

Essentially this is just a case of curiousity and the desire to have a new toy to program and play with (i.e. calculating code metrics).

For now the best reference is in my [latest gists](https://gist.github.com/basp) or in the code. Don't bother looking in `Raina.Cmd` or `Raina.Facts` because they are shamefully stubbed.
